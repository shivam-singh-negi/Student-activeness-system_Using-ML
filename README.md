# Student-activeness-system_Using-ML
In this system the student will be asked certain number of questions during an session(online class maybe) at any random time . The student can either miss , attempt the question within a time frame after that the question window will clossed. Along with this the system will capture details like no of scrolls ,clicks and mouse movements that took place  during the entriire session and during the questions window pop up. At the end of the session the data like right , wrong, missed questions, accuracy of answering right, mouse clicks , scroll and user_id  will be send to a centralised server. The server will accumulate the same data from multiple user . This will built up the dataset. On the dataset formed we will implement Machine learning algorithms like SVM and KNN to train the system to classify the userid into categories like "very Active", "active", "Less Active" and "Least active".
